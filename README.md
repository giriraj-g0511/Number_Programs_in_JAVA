 To undestand code you must have knowledge about Java concepts like if-else,loops,method,return statement,break statement,Scanner class,static members and their work,etc.
 If you have knowledge on these concept then you can easily undestand the working flow of code and for better understanding you can use pen and paper for traccing of code.
